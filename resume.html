    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I've had the opportunity to engage in a variety of roles, 
        from overseeing home renovations to teaching music and serving a church mission in Bolivia. 
        Teaching cello and voice allowed me to mentor budding musicians, instilling confidence and independence. 
        While on my mission, I managed finances and facilitated communication among teams, leaving a positive impact on the communities I served. 
        Through these experiences, I've developed versatile skills in leadership, communication, and service.
